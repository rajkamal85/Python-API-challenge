# Python-API-challenge

In this example, I'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

My first objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Temperature (F) vs. Latitude,
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude,
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude,
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude.

For next objective, run linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):
----------------------------------------------------------
Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude,
Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude,
Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude,
Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude,
Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude,
Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude,
Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude,
Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude.

> Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
> Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
> Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
> Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.



For other part:
-----------------
Using jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for this part of the assignment
_________________________________________________________________________________
> Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from the part I of the homework.
> Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:
> A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.
> Wind speed less than 10 mph.
> Zero cloudiness.
> Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.
> Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.
> Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country.
